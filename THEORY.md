## Molecules Studied:

| Molecule |   Properties Scanned  | Qubits Required |
|----------|-----------------------|-----------------|
|    H‚ÇÇ    |   Ans√§tz & Optimizer  |       $4$       |
|    LiH   | Bond length variation |       $12$      |
|    H‚ÇÇO   | Bond angle variation  |       $14$      |

All simulations use the **STO-3G** basis set for consistency.
Molecular Hamiltonians are constructed using **second quantization** and mapped to qubit operators via the **Jordan-Wigner** transformation (via PennyLane's `qchem` module).

## Background

### Variational Principle

The variational principle states that for any trial wavefunction $|\psi‚ü©$, the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is an upper bound to the true ground state energy:
```
E‚ÇÄ ‚â§ ‚ü®œà|H|œà‚ü©
```
where:
- $E_0$ is the ground state energy
- $|\psi‚ü©$ is any normalized wavefunction
- $H$ is the Hamiltonian

### Hartree-Fock

The Hartree-Fock state is written as the tensor product of a qubit state $\phi$ for every electron orbital:
```
|HF‚ü© = |œÜ‚ÇÅœÜ‚ÇÇ...œÜ‚Çô‚ü©
```
For LiH with $4$ electrons in $12$ orbitals, the HF reference state is ```|111100000000‚ü©```, which describes electrons occupying the four lowest energy orbital states.

## VQE Algorithm Overview

The VQE algorithm consists of:
1. **State Preparation**: Prepare parameterized quantum state $|\psi(\theta)‚ü©$
2. **Measurement**: Measure expectation value $‚ü®\psi(\theta)| H |\psi(\theta)‚ü©$
3. **Optimization**: Classically optimize parameters $\theta$ to minimize energy
4. **Iteration**: Repeat until convergence

### Ans√§tz Construction:

An ans√§tze defines the functional form of the trial quantum state $|\psi(\theta)‚ü©$.
It determines how expressive, efficient, and trainable your VQE circuit is.
Different ans√§tze trade off physical accuracy, circuit depth, and compatibility with quantum hardware.

#### UCCSD (Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles)

A chemistry-inspired ans√§tze derived from coupled-cluster theory. Includes single and double excitations applied in a unitary, Trotterized form.

- Designed for capturing electron correlation from first principles
- Exact for small systems like H‚ÇÇ in minimal basis sets (e.g., STO-3G)
- Can become deep and resource-intensive for larger molecules

#### $R_Y-C_Z$ Ans√§tz

A hardware-efficient ans√§tze composed of layers alternating single-qubit rotations and entangling gates.

- Uses $R_Y$ rotations followed by a chain of $C_Z$ gates
- Tunable number of layers (depth)
- Good expressibility for small and medium systems
- Easier to implement on near-term hardware

#### Minimal / One-Parameter Ans√§tz

A manually constructed, problem-specific ans√§tze using very few parameters.

- Tailored for simple systems like H‚ÇÇ in minimal basis
- Uses a single $R_Y$ rotation and one entangling gate (e.g., CNOT)
- Extremely shallow and interpretable
- Useful for testing optimizers, energy landscapes, or learning curves

### Optimizers:

Classical optimizers are a critical component of the VQE algorithm, as they minimize the energy by adjusting circuit parameters $\theta$.

#### AdamOptimizer

Designed for fast, stable optimization by combining the benefits of momentum and adaptive learning rates.
- Automatically adjusts step size for each parameter
- Performs well in noisy or irregular energy landscapes
- Common default in VQE due to ease of use and robustness

#### GradientDescentOptimizer

The simplest optimizer, as it updates parameters in the direction of steepest descent.
- Useful for educational or baseline comparisons
- Very sensitive to step size
- Often slower and less reliable in quantum settings

#### MomentumOptimizer

Adds inertia to gradient descent to smooth parameter updates and help escape shallow local minima.
- Useful when gradients fluctuate heavily
- Reduces oscillations near minima
- Often used as a stepping stone toward more adaptive optimizers

#### NesterovMomentumOptimizer

An improvement over standard momentum optimizers that ‚Äúlooks ahead‚Äù before making updates.
- Accelerates convergence in smooth regions
- Helps avoid getting stuck in flat or gently curved regions
- Can be unstable if not tuned carefully

#### AdagradOptimizer

Adapts learning rates for each parameter based on past gradient history.
- Useful when some parameters require more aggressive updates than others
- Can become sluggish over time as it overcorrects

#### SPSAOptimizer

(Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation)

Designed for noisy or hardware-executed circuits, where gradients are expensive or unreliable.
- Estimates the gradient using random perturbations
- Requires very few circuit evaluations per step
- Performs well in realistic noisy quantum environments
